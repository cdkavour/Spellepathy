Driver Program:
	1. Initialize Game
	2. While no team has reached Phase 6:
		For each player:
			Player Take Turn


Classes & Data Structures
	Game Class:
		TeamArray
		PlayerArray  	(Need to be same instances as stored in the Team Class)
		Turn counter	(int)
		NextIsVowel		(bool: True = next card is Vowel, False = next card is consonant)

	Player Class:
		Player Letter Hand
		Player Impactor Hand
		PlayerID 		(int) - matches index in PlayerArray
		PartnerID 		(int) - matches index in PlayerArray
		TeamID			(int) - matches index in TeamArray


	Team Class:
		TeamPlayerArray
		Score			(int)
		Phase			(int)
		PlaySpace 		
		TeamID			(int) - matches index in TeamArray
		Skips			(int)

	PlaySpace:
		word 			(string of * for unplayed, ? for unknown, and chars A-Z)
		unknownIsVowel	(bool: True for unknown is Vowel, False for unknown is consonant)

	Player Letter Hand -- Dict mapping Letter Card IDs to counts
	Player Impactor Hand -- Dict mapping Impactor Card IDs to counts


Methods & Functions:

Game:

	ConsonantCardGenerator
	VowelCardGenerator

	LetterCardGenerator -- RNG from [0, TOTAL_LETTER_CARDS-1], maps number to letter card & return that letter card index

	IMPACTORCardGenerator -- RNG from [0-TOTAL_IMPACTOR_CARDS-1], maps number to impactor card & return that impactor card index

Team:
	PhaseIsComplete():
		if PlaySpace is complete (no *s left):
			flip ? to value new letter from either ConsonantCardGenerator or VowelCardGenerator, based on PlaySpace.unknownIsVowel
			increment team's Phase
			reset PlaySpace to string of PHASELENGTH[Phase], all ?s.

Player:

	Player.DrawLetter():
		get letter from LetterCardGenerator, add to hand

	Player.DrawImpactor():
		get impactor from ImpactorCardGenerator, add to hand

	Player.DiscardLetter(letter):
		decrement letter cound of letter from hand

	* TODO - Add logic for submitting word, checking word, and giving out penalties/resetting Phase appropriately *
	Player.PlayLetter(letter, index):
		set team's PlaySpace.word[index] to letter.
		decrement letter cound of letter from hand
		check if Teams[Player.TeamID].PhaseIsComplete()

	Player.RemoveLetter(space):
		set PlaySpace[index] to *

	Player.PerformReveal:
		flip ? to value new letter from either ConsonantCardGenerator or VowelCardGenerator, based on PlaySpace.unknownIsVowel
		Reduce score by 3
		Increase team's skips by number of *s in PlaySpace.word
